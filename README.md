book store  - mini front-end JS project. 

before starting use the project, in a one-time manner, you should run the page loadingLocal.js to save data on your browser.
then you can run the site correctly.

for manage each book on the store you can use a few options:

create - add a new book for the store.
update - every book updatable by you.
delete - you can delete every book.
read - see the book details in side of the screen.
